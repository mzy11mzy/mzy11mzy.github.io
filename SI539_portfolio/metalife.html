        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="regular"> What is Life? If a liquid metal droplet can hunt for game, play with companions, and even display personality traits such as shyness, curiosity, brightness and naughtiness, is it alive? MetaLife is a series of interactive installations, representing different "personalities" of liquid metal "mollusks". When interacting with the audience, the mollusks present personalities and hopefully provide the audience to wonder what life actually is.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p class="regular">We provide a very simple way for children to create a multi-animatronics drama show! ZOOO is a multi-animatronics stage that can control several animatronics simultaneously. It simplifies the procedure of scripting motions for multi-animatronics as well as enriching interactions between animatronics. With supporting software, interactions like dancing, chatting, chasing, and hide-and-seek can be created quickly and intuitively.</p>

But whenever it detects the approach of humans, it will get scared and quickly retreat back to its safe nest. </p></div>
        <div class="col-md-6"><p class="regular"> This creature is very curious about its environment. It seems to enjoy playing and looks for the companionship of other individuals. When someone approaches, it will show great interest and move to them directly. </p></div>

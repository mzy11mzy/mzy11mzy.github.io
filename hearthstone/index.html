  </div>
  <div class="project-real-content col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
    <p>Hearthstone is a collectible card game developed by Blizzard Entertainment and is set in the Warcraft universe. Each Hearthstone game is played with a 30-card deck, made up entirely of cards that have been unlocked in the player's collection. Cards are divided into 5 qualities, or rarity categories. Basic cards are cards that you are guaranteed to receive, either for finishing the tutorial or for leveling up classes. The other four rarities of cards correspond to the likelihood that the card will be opened up in a pack. Common cards are the most likely to appear in a pack, followed by Rare cards, then Epic cards, then Legendary cards. As cards increase in rarity, they tend to have more narrow or unique effects on the game. Though there are powerful and highly playable cards of all rarities, on average, high rarity cards tend to be more powerful than low rarity cards. And that's the reason why getting a lengary card from pack is the dream for every Heathstone player.</P>

    <h2>Arcane Dust</h2>
    <p>Arcane Dust is the resource players use to construct cards of their choice. As Hearthstone packs contain random cards, acquiring Arcane Dust is the best way to acquire the specific cards you need for your collection. Any card in your collection can be disenchanted and turned into Arcane Dust, rewarding an amount of Arcane Dust to the player depending on the card's rarity. As each Hearthstone deck can contain a maximum of 2 copies of each card, every copy in your collection beyond the 2nd is unnecessary and should be turned into Arcane Dust. You can also disenchant any card that you do not intend to use.</p>

    <h2>Probability</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="project-real-content col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
    <p>Making predictions about something, like when will I draw a lengendary card , is always a difficult task. However, with the probability theory, we can provide the best estimate of the chace that you will get a lengendary card in your next pack. For example, we know the probability of drawing a legendary card is 1%, which means if you repeatedly open packs many times, you would expect about about one percent of the cards to be legendary. </p>

  <h2>Expected Value</h2>

<div class="project-real-content col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
  <p>The expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values. In other words, each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value.</p>
  <p>In finite case, let X be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes x1, x2, x3, …, …xn occurring with probabilities with p1, p2, p3, …, …, pn, respectively. The expectation of X is defined as</P>
